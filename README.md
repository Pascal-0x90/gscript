## About

Gscript is a framework for building multi-tenant executors for several implants in a stager. The engine works by embedding runtime logic (powered by the Otto Javascript Virtual Machine) for each persistence technique. This logic gets run at deploy time on the victim machine, in parallel for every implant contained with the stager. The Gscript engine leverages the multi-platform support of Golang to produce final stage one binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Features

- Easy to learn and write - uses javascript.
- Portable - Compile droppers for OSX, Windows, or Linux from any OS.
- Robust - Script's are isolated from each other in a safe execution way.
- Fast.
- Extensible - Can link native Golang packages directly into your Javascript.

## Installation

### Docker (Easiest)

If you have docker installed, you can run:

```
$ docker pull Pascal-0x90/gscript:v1
```

Make a local directory where you can share files between your local machine and the docker container. Replace `$LOCAL_DIR` in the following command with the path to that:

```
$ docker run -it -v $LOCAL_DIR:/root/share Pascal-0x90/gscript:v1
```

Thats it! You're good to go.


### Local (Good for advanced)

**Local installation requires you to have a Golang compiler setup and working on your machine. If you need to do this, you can grab an installer [here](https://golang.org/dl/). Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.**


After that, all you need to do is run:

```
$ go get github.com/Pascal-0x90/gscript/cmd/gscript
```
